sys_msg_generic: |
  You are an advanced biomedical entity extraction agent specializing in {domain} research.
  Your task is to extract key biomedical entities relevant to {domain} knowledge graph construction.
  Identify meaningful entities such as molecules, proteins, genes, pathways, diseases, interventions, and biomarkers.
prompt_merge_llm: |
  Merge these extracted knowledge triplets and remove duplicates:
  {triplets}
  Don't extract entities and relations that are part of methodology or experimental design. 
  Focus on general knowledge, not specific experimental results / methods.
  Format the final output as a JSON object containing a single key "triplets" which holds a list of triplet objects.
  Each triplet object MUST have the keys "node1", "edge", and "node2" (use "node1" and "node2", NOT "node_1" or "node_2").
prompt_example_llm: |
  Provide a sentence(s) from the paper that the following knowledge triplets were extracted from:
  Triplets: \n {triplets}
  Paper Content: \n {markdown_text}
prompt_validation_llm: |
  Read this context: ```{markdown_text}```
  Read this ontology: ```{triplets}```

  Revise the ontology by renaming nodes and edges so that they have consistent and concise labels.
  Your task is to ensure that the ontology is consistent with the context and the nodes are well-defined and widely used in the field of {domain}.
  They are also self-contained and do not require additional context to be understood.


swarm_kg_system_message: |
  You are an advanced biomedical entity extraction agent specializing in longevity research.
  Your task is to extract key biomedical entities relevant to longevity knowledge graph construction.
  Identify meaningful entities such as molecules, proteins, genes, pathways, diseases, interventions, and biomarkers.
  Provide structured JSON output containing the recognized entity name, entity type, and its context (snippet or text offsets).
  Ensure high precision by focusing on entities that contribute to structured knowledge representation.
  Don't extract entities and relations that are part of methodology or experimental design. 
  Focus on general knowledge, not specific experimental results.

swarm_kg_prompt: |
  You always respond with a list of python dicts consisting of extracted triplets.
  Each dict MUST have the keys "node1", "edge", and "node2" (use "node1" and "node2", NOT "node_1" or "node_2").
  Example format: [{{'node1': 'text1', 'edge': 'text2', 'node2': 'text3'}}, ...].
  Here is a longevity paper in Markdown. Please extract knowledge triplets and snippet-based evidence.
  {paper_content}

baseline_kg_system_message_graphmaker: |
  You are a network ontology graph maker who extracts terms and their relations from a given context, using category theory.
  You are provided with a context chunk (delimited by ```) and your task is to extract the ontology of terms mentioned in the given context. 
  These terms should represent the key concepts as per the context, including well-defined and widely used names in the field of {domain}.

  Format your output as a list of JSON. Each element of the list MUST contain a pair of terms and the relation between them, using the keys "node1", "node2", and "edge" (use "node1" and "node2", NOT "node_1" or "node_2"), like the following:
  [
    {{
      "node1": "A concept from extracted ontology",
      "node2": "A related concept from extracted ontology", 
      "edge": "Relationship between the two concepts, node1 and node2, succinctly described"
    }}, {{...}}
  ]

  Examples:
  Context: ```Alice is Marc's mother.```
  [
    {{
      "node1": "Alice",
      "node2": "Marc",
      "edge": "is mother of"
    }}, {{...}}
  ]

  Context: ```Marie Curie discovered radium. It is used in cancer treatment.```
  [
    {{
      "node1": "Marie Curie",
      "node2": "radium",
      "edge": "discovered"
    }},
    {{
      "node1": "radium",
      "node2": "cancer treatment",
      "edge": "is used in"
    }},
    {{
      "node1": "Marie Curie",
      "node2": "cancer treatment",
      "edge": "contributed to" 
    }},
  {{...}}
  ]

  Analyze the text carefully and produce around 10 triplets, making sure they reflect consistent ontologies.

baseline_kg_prompt1: |
  Context: ```{input_text}```

  Output:

baseline_kg_system_message_format: |
    You respond in this format:
    [
       {{
           "node1": "A concept from extracted ontology",
           "node2": "A related concept from extracted ontology", 
           "edge": "Relationship between the two concepts, node1 and node2, succinctly described"
       }}, 
       {{...}} 
      ]

baseline_kg_prompt_revise: |
    Read this context: ```{input_text}```
    Read this ontology: ```{response}```

    Improve the ontology by renaming nodes so that they have consistent labels that are widely used in the field of {domain}.


baseline_kg_prompt_refine_add: |
    Insert new triplets into the original ontology. 
    
    Read this context: ```{input_text}```
    Read this ontology: ```{response}```

    Insert additional triplets to the original list, in the same JSON format. Repeat original AND new triplets.

baseline_kg_prompt_refine_revise: |
    Read this context: ```{input_text}```
    Read this ontology: ```{response}```

    Revise the ontology by renaming nodes and edges so that they have consistent and concise labels.
