# ARD Community Extensions

Welcome to the future of scientific discovery, **developers!**

You're here to build the infrastructure for **agentic science** - where AI agents and human intelligence collaborate to accelerate research at unprecedented scale. This is where you create extensions that don't just process data, but actively participate in the scientific method.

## 🧬 What You Can Build

Imagine AI agents that:
- 🔍 **Explore vast scientific knowledge** like a researcher wandering through interconnected ideas
- 🧠 **Generate novel hypotheses** by connecting concepts in unexpected ways  
- 🤝 **Collaborate intelligently** with different agents playing specialized roles
- 📊 **Ground their reasoning** in real scientific literature and data

Your multi-agent system takes a focused piece of scientific knowledge (a "subgraph") and transforms it into a research hypothesis that could lead to real breakthroughs.

## 💡 Why Contribute?

- **🏥 Impact Real Science**: Your AI agents could generate hypotheses that lead to new treatments and discoveries
- **🧠 Master Cutting-Edge AI**: Get hands-on experience with multi-agent systems and scientific reasoning
- **🌍 Join a Mission**: Be part of democratizing scientific discovery for everyone

## 🎯 Our First Community Extension: BeeHealthy

We're not just open sourcing our tools - we're leading by example! **BeeHealthy** is our first community extension, showcasing the full potential of multi-agent hypothesis generation.
